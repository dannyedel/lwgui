lwgui
=====
Lightweight C++11 graphical user interface library


State
=====
This is currently in a brainstorming state, don't expect any part of this to work anytime soon.


Goals
=====
The goals are to create a library that's easy to use even by a C++ novice,
implementable on many different systems
and which creates programs that feel native to the platform,
instead of programs that try to look and feel the same on all platforms.

Functionality duplication is to be avoided, use the standard (template) library as much as possible and
try to adopt its coding style as much as possible.
